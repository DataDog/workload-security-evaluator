## Requirements

Workload Security Evaluator runs on Docker. We recommend launching a compute instance in your preferred cloud provider for the most accurate results. Alternatively, use a virtual machine or Docker Desktop. Apple silicon is not supported.

## Getting started

1. Build and run the containers with the following commands.
```
export DD_API_KEY="<api-key>" # Found at https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```
2. Enter the evaluator container and run atomics.
```
docker exec -it atomicredteam /usr/bin/pwsh
Invoke-AtomicTest T1105-27 -ShowDetails
Invoke-AtomicTest T1105-27 -GetPrereqs # Download packages or payloads
Invoke-AtomicTest T1105-27
```
3. Check for a signal in Datadog [Signals Explorer](https://app.datadoghq.com/security?query=env%3Aemulation) page. Signals from Workload Security Evaluator are tagged with `env:emulation` to differentiate them from real security threats.
4. Revert the changes made by the atomic.
```
Invoke-AtomicTest T1053.003-2 -Cleanup
```
5. Repeat with a different atomic.
6. Shutdown the containers.
```
docker compose down
```

## Atomic Red Team organization

Atomic Red Team often contains multiple tests for the same ATT&CK technique. For example, the test identifier T1136.001-1 refers to the first test for MITRE ATT&CK technique T1136.001 (Create Account: Local Account). This test creates an account on a Linux system. The second test, T1136.001-2, creates an account on a MacOS system.

## Recommended tests

The following atomics are recommended as a starting point. They emulate techniques that were observed in real attacks targeting cloud workloads.

For a full list of Datadog's runtime detections, visit the [Out-of-the-box (OOTB) rules](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/default_rules/#cat-workload-security) page. MITRE ATT&CK tactic and technique information is provided for every rule.

## Techniques not relevant to production workloads

The MITRE ATT&CK [Linux Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/linux/) contains techniques for Linux hosts with a variety of purposes. Testing the techniques located in [notrelevant.md](notrelevant.md) is not recommended because they are focused on Linux workstations or are unlikely to be detected using operating system events.
